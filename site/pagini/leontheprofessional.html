        <h1>THE PLOT</h1> 
        <h3>"Leon: The Professional" is a 1994 French thriller film directed by Luc Besson. 
            The plot revolves around the titular character, Leon, a solitary and skilled hitman (played by Jean Reno), who lives a disciplined and solitary life in New York City. 
            His life takes an unexpected turn when he becomes the reluctant guardian of Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl whose family is brutally murdered by a corrupt DEA agent named Norman Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman). 
            Mathilda, seeking revenge and refuge, convinces Leon to teach her his trade so she can avenge her family's death. Initially resistant, Leon eventually agrees and begins to train Mathilda in the art of assassination. Their bond grows deeper as they navigate the dangers of the criminal underworld together.
            As Mathilda grows closer to Leon, her feelings for him become more complex, eventually turning into a romantic infatuation despite their vast age difference. Meanwhile, Stansfield continues his ruthless pursuit of Mathilda and Leon, leading to a climactic showdown between the two sides.
            The film explores themes of redemption, loneliness, and the blurred lines between good and evil. It's known for its intense action sequences, stylish direction, and memorable performances, particularly from Reno, Portman, and Oldman.</h3>
