        <h1>THE PLOT</h1>
        <h3>Jim Carroll is a talented young basketball player attending a Catholic high school in New York City. He dreams of playing basketball professionally and is a promising athlete. 
            Jim and his friends, Mickey, Pedro, and Neutron, spend their time playing basketball, goofing around, and experimenting with drugs.
            As the film progresses, Jim's experimentation with drugs turns into a serious addiction. He starts using heroin and quickly becomes dependent on it. 
            His life begins to fall apart as he steals, lies, and distances himself from his friends and family to support his habit. He gets expelled from school, loses his place on the basketball team, and eventually becomes homeless.
            Jim's descent into addiction leads him to a life of crime and desperation. He robs stores, mugs people, and engages in other criminal activities to get money for drugs. 
            His friends also struggle with their own addictions, and the once close-knit group falls apart.
            Throughout the film, Jim's internal struggle is depicted through his writing and poetry, which he uses as an outlet for his pain and experiences. 
            He eventually hits rock bottom and ends up in jail. With the help of his mother and a friend who helps him get into rehab, Jim starts his journey to recovery.
            The film ends on a somewhat hopeful note, showing Jim in recovery and working towards rebuilding his life, although the scars of his addiction remain. 
            "The Basketball Diaries" is a gritty and realistic portrayal of the destructive power of drug addiction and the difficult path to recovery. 
            The film is notable for Leonardo DiCaprio's powerful performance and its raw depiction of the struggles faced by those dealing with substance abuse.</h3>
