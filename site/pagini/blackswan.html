        <h3>Black Swan is a 2010 American psychological horror film directed by Darren Aronofsky from a screenplay by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin, and Andres Heinz, based on a story by Heinz. 
            The film stars Natalie Portman in the lead role, with Vincent Cassel, Mila Kunis, Barbara Hershey, and Winona Ryder in supporting roles. The plot revolves around a production of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake by the company of New York City Ballet. 
            The production requires a ballerina to play the innocent and fragile White Swan, for which the committed dancer Nina Sayers (Portman) is a perfect fit, as well as the dark and sensual Black Swan, which are qualities better embodied by the new rival Lily (Kunis). 
            Nina is overwhelmed by a feeling of immense pressure when she finds herself competing for the role, causing her to lose her tenuous grip on reality and descend into madness.</h3>

        <h1>THE PLOT</h1>
        <h3>"Black Swan" is a psychological thriller that follows the story of Nina Sayers, a young and talented ballet dancer played by Natalie Portman, who is chosen to play the lead role in a New York City production of "Swan Lake." 
            Nina is perfect for the innocent and fragile White Swan, but she struggles to embody the seductive and dark Black Swan.
            As Nina strives for perfection, she becomes increasingly obsessed with her role, blurring the lines between reality and hallucination. 
            She faces competition from a new dancer, Lily, played by Mila Kunis, who embodies everything Nina is not: uninhibited, free-spirited, and sensual.
            Nina's psychological state deteriorates as she grapples with her demanding mother, her manipulative director, and her own inner demons. 
            She starts experiencing vivid hallucinations and paranoia, believing that Lily is out to sabotage her.
            As the pressure mounts, Nina's quest for perfection pushes her to the brink of insanity. 
            The film culminates in a dramatic and hallucinatory final performance of "Swan Lake," where Nina fully embraces her dark side as the Black Swan, ultimately leading to a shocking and tragic conclusion.
            "Black Swan" explores themes of perfection, competition, duality, and the price of ambition, all set against the backdrop of the cutthroat world of professional ballet. 
            It is a gripping and intense film that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats until the very end.</h3>
